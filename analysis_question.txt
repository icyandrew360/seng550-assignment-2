1. If the order is received by orders.py before the customer changes are received, 
Query 1 and 3 will reflect incorrect data. Since the order date will technically be within
the effective and end date of the previous city rather than the one they placed the order
in, query 1 and 3 will treat the customer's order as if it was from the last city.
